# IoT-project
This is about a project that I am working on. This is still in progress and so I have kept this in private.
I will keep giving updates in here to myself like an update log starting from v1.0.2.

#V1.0.2:
Added home, about this project, live data and health predictor all with ne page each except home which currently has only the story in it with 7 pages only.

#Added update log and some precautions- try bug fixes 6:
Just sorting out the libraries and fixed a typo in requirements.txt as my health predictor required ML libraries which I forgot to add in requirements.txt.
