# IoT-project
This is about a project that I am working on. This is still in progress but I have kept this public.I will keep giving updates in here to myself like an update log starting from v1.0.2.

#V1.0.2:
Added home, about this project, live data and health predictor all with one page each except home which currently has only the story in it with 7 pages only.

#Added update log and some precautions - try bug fixes 6:
Just sorting out the libraries and fixed a typo in requirements.txt as my health predictor required ML libraries which I forgot to add in requirements.txt.

#V1.1.0:
I have added another page to live data called graphed results and my inital vision is now complete now I will get more ideas and progress on making my website bigger, better and more professional. Thank you.

#V1.1.1
To make my website more professional I have added a search engine! While it might not seem like much now as my website expands this will become essential and I feel like it is a good thing to do early as if I do it late then it might not adapt with my code.
